ROS 2 Humble Client Node communicating with Jetson Nano over local Wi-Fi via ZeroMQ.
Translates binary ZMQ streams into native ROS 2 topics:
  - Publishes /scan (LaserScan) from LD19
  - Publishes /odom (Odometry) from STM32
  - Publishes /imu/data_raw (Imu) from STM32
  - Publishes /battery/measured_voltage and /battery/measured_current
  - Subscribes to /cmd_vel (Twist) and sends commands to Jetson

    """Translates the Jetson's time.time() stamps into this machine's clock.

    Every payload carries the instant the Jetson SAMPLED it. This node used to
    throw that away and stamp on arrival instead, which folds the whole
    transport delay into the measurement time - and over Wi-Fi that delay is
    not a constant. It idles near a millisecond and spikes to hundreds under
    congestion.

    A scan delayed 300 ms but labelled "now" is handed to slam_toolbox as
    though the room had rotated by whatever the robot turned through in the
    meantime. The matcher duly rotates map -> odom to make it fit and then,
    believing its own correction, redraws the walls in the new place: the
    sudden spin on the spot, followed by a second set of boundaries.

    The two machines keep independent clocks, so (t_recv - t_send) is
    offset + delay, with delay >= 0 and unknown. The MINIMUM of that difference
    over a window is therefore the cleanest estimate of the offset available:
    it is the sample that happened to suffer least delay. Everything above the
    minimum is transport delay, which yields a corrected stamp AND a
    per-message age for free, with no NTP and no clock discipline anywhere.

    Two properties worth preserving if this is ever edited:
      * age is >= 0 by construction (the current sample is inside the window),
        so a corrected stamp can never land in the future and trip TF
        extrapolation.
      * a laptop clock that jumps BACKWARDS - a WSL suspend/resume will do it -
        creates a new minimum immediately and is absorbed on the next message.
        Drift the other way is absorbed as the window slides.
